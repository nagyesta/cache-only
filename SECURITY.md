# Security Policy

## Supported Versions 

The aim is to support the fellow developers who are using this library as much as
possible but at the end of the day, this is a hobby project which maintained in
my free time. So reality is that the latest version will be supported with security
patches in case vulnerabilities are reported and everything else will be decided
case by case.

[![Supported version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/nagyesta/cache-only?color=green&logo=git&label=Supported%20version&sort=semver)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/nagyesta/cache-only?color=green&logo=git&label=Supported%20version&sort=semver)

Thank you in advance!
